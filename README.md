# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a summary of ride-share data by city type: urban, suburban and rural. The resulting analaysis displays the total weekly fares by city type in a multi-line graph


## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv , ride_data.csv
- Software: Pyton 3.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.60.1

## Results
The following table compares the the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. As the table shows, there are more rides in increasingly urban areas. Even though the average per ride and per driver is lower in the more urban areas, the increased number of rides results in higher total fares for urban areas.

The trends described above are displayed graphically in the following table which displays the total weekly fare in each area type: rural, suburban, and urban.

## Summary
The following are business recommendations adressing the disparities among the city types:

1. Urban areas generate the most fares out of the city types: funding for campaigns in urban areas should not be cut or diminished inany way to maintain profits
2. Lower fares correlate to increased number of rides. To encourage increased ridership, it would make sense to make an effort to reduce fares in rural areas to increase the total number of rides. 
3. Furthermore, to increase ridership in less populated areas, drivers should be informed that the average fare per driver is the highest in rural areas. This will increase the number of available drivers in the areas, likely increasing the total fares collected in these areas.
